# PharoStyle

PharoStyle is a tool that generates a document containing the style guidelines for writing code for the [Pharo](www.pharo.org) programming language.

This document is generated from Pharo's lint rules. Lint rules are used to automatically check code in order to find
 - possible bugs
 - possible optimizations
 - design flaws
 - coding idiom violations
 - style violations

> A first version of this document generated from latest Pharo 6 (2016-08-27) can be found in [here](style.md)
